- lib/: This is the documentation for the modules in bashly. It
  ranges from documenting function parameters and return codes, to
  the presentation of simple usage examples of the functions.

- meta/: Meta is the place for discussions regarding the development
  of bashly itself, like naming convention, parameter passing
  conventions (and hacks!), and related topics.

- tutorials/: This is a more free form repository of tutorials for
  various parts of bashly, and even an attempt at a bash tutorial
  driven by examples. This directory also contains a more in-depth
  introduction to bashly.
